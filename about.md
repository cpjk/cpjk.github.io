Hi, I'm Chris, and you've found my website.

In case you're wondering, I am a programmer and Software Engineering student at the University of Victoria.

My hobbies are rock climbing and programming, and I am a volunteer member of Royal Canadian Marine Search and Rescue Station 33.

I am currently on co-op as a Software Developer at <a href="http://freerunningtech.com">FreeRunning Technologies</a>
