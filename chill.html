At Shopify, I worked primarily on the merchant-facing "Timeline" interface, which tracks events associated with different resources, such as orders and inventory transfers. During my time at Shopify:

              <ul>
                <li>
                  I improved Timeline's user interface and user experience.

                  I led research into improving image compression optimization.
